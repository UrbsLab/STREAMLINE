# Sample Outputs

## Demonstration Data

Included with this pipeline is a folder named DemoData including two small datasets used as a
demonstration of pipeline efficacy. New users can easily run the included Colab or jupyter notebook
'as-is', and it will be run automatically on these datasets.

The first dataset 'hcc-data_example.csv' is the Hepatocellular Carcinoma (HCC) dataset taken from the UCI
Machine Learning repository. It includes 165 instances, 49 fetaures, and a binary class label.
It also includes a mix of categorical and numeric features, about 10% missing values, and class imbalance,
i.e. 63 deceased (class = 1), and 102 surived (class 0).

The second dataset 'hcc-data_example_no_covariates.csv' is the same as the first except we have
removed two covariates, i.e. Age at Diagnosis, and Gender. Having this second dataset in the DemoData folder serves to
illustrate how STREAMLINE can be applied to more than one dataset at once.

Furthermore, to demonstrate how STREAMLINE-trained models may be applied to
new or replication data we have simply added a copy of 'hcc-data_example.csv', renamed 'hcc-data_example_rep.csv' within the DemoRepData folder.
While this is not a true replication dataset (as none was available for this example) it is useful here to test out the code. However, note that model performance will be higher on this replication dataset example since it includes the data the model was trained on.

When applying trained models to a true replication dataset users should generally expect model performance to be weaker (or similar at best) in comparison to the individual testing evaluations completed for each CV model within.


## Run Pipeline and Output Folders
* To quickly pre-view the pipeline (pre-run on included [demonstration datasets](#demonstration-data) without any installation whatsoever, open the following link:

[https://github.com/UrbsLab/STREAMLINE/blob/dev/STREAMLINE-Notebook.ipynb](https://github.com/UrbsLab/STREAMLINE/blob/dev/STREAMLINE-Notebook.ipynb)

Note, that with the above link, you can only view the pre-run STREAMLINE Jupyter Notebook and will not be able to run or permanently edit the code. This is an easy way to get a feel for what the pipeline is and does.

* To quickly pre-view the folder of output files generated when running STREAMLINE on the [demonstration datasets](#demonstration-data), open the following link:
