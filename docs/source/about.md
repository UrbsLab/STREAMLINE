#  About (FAQs)


## How is STREAMLINE different from other AutoML tools?
Unlike most other AutoML tools, STREAMLINE was designed as a framework to rigorously apply
and compare a variety of ML modeling algorithms and collectively learn from them as opposed
to only identifying a best performing model and/or attempting to optimize the analysis pipeline
configuration itself. STREAMLINE adopts a fixed series of purposefully selected steps/phases
in line with data science best practices. It seeks to automate all domain generalizable
elements of an ML analysis pipeline with a specific focus on biomedical data mining challenges.
This tool can be run or utilized in a number of ways to suite a variety experience levels and
levels of problem/data complexity.

***
## What were our goals in developing STREAMLINE?
The goal of STREAMLINE is to provide an easy and transparent framework
to learn predictive associations from tabular data. The design of this pipeline
is meant to not only pick a best performing algorithm/model for a given dataset,
but to leverage the different algorithm perspectives (i.e. biases, strengths,
and weaknesses) to gain a broader understanding of the associations in that data.

The overall development of this pipeline focused on:
   1. Automation and ease of use
   2. Avoiding and detecting common sources of bias
   3. Optimizing modeling performance
   4. Ensuring reproducibility (see STREAMLINE parameter settings)
   5. Capturing complex associations in data (e.g. feature interactions)
   6. Enhancing interpretability of output
   7. Run mode flexibility
   8. More advanced users can easily add their own scikit-learn compatible modeling algorithms to STREAMLINE

***
## What does STREAMLINE automate?
Currently, STREAMLINE automates the following aspects of analysis (see schematic below):
   1. Exploratory analysis
   2. Data processing (basic cleaning, CV partitioning, scaling, imputation)
   3. Feature processing
      * Filter-based feature importance estimation (Mutual information & MultiSURF)
      * Feature selection (using a 'collective', i.e. multi-algorithm approach)
   4. Modeling with 'Optuna' hyperparameter optimization using up to 15 implemented ML algorithms (see below)
   5. Testing data evaluations using 15 classification metrics and model feature importance estimation
   6. Generates and organizes all results and other outputs including:
      * Tables (Model evaluations, runtimes, selected hyperparameters, etc.)
      * Publication-ready plots/figures & model visualizations
      * Trained models (stored as pickled objects for re-use)
      * Training and testing CV datasets (for external reproducibility)
   6. Non-parametric statistical comparisons across ML algorithms and analyzed datasets
   7. Summary report generation (as pre-formatted PDF) including:
      * STREAMLINE run settings used
      * Dataset characteristics summary
      * Key figures and model evaluation results averaged over CV runs
      * Runtime summary
   8. Applying and evaluating all STREAMLINE-trained models on further/future
      hold out replication data

The following 16 scikit-learn compatible ML modeling algorithms are currently included as options:
1. Naive Bayes (NB)
2. Logistic Regression (LR)
3. Elastic Net (EN)
4. Decision Tree (DT)
5. Random Forest (RF)
6. Gradient Boosting (GB)
7. XGBoost (XGB)
8. LGBoost (LGB)
9. CatBoost (CGB)
10. Support Vector Machine (SVM)
11. Artificial Neural Network (ANN)
12. K-Nearest Neighbors (k-NN)
13. Genetic Programming (GP)
14. Eductional Learning Classifier System (eLCS)
15. 'X' Classifier System (XCS)
16. Extended Supervised Tracking and Classifying System (ExSTraCS).

Classification-relevant hyperparameter values and ranges have been carefully
selected for each algorithm and have been pre-specified for the automated (Optuna-driven)
automated hyperparameter sweep.

The automatically formatted PDF reports generated by STREAMLINE are intended
to give a brief summary of pipeline settings and key results.
A folder containing all results, statistical analyses publication-ready plots/figures,
models, and other outputs is saved allowing users to carefully examine all aspects of
analysis performance.  

We have also included a variety of useful Jupyter Notebooks
designed to operate on this output folder giving users quick paths to do even more
with the pipeline output. Examples include:
1. Accessing prediction probabilities
2. Regenerating figures to user-specifications
3. Trying out the effect of different prediction thresholds on selected
   models with an interactive slider
4. Re-evaluating models when applying a new prediction threshold
5. Generating an interactive model feature importance ranking visualization across
   all ML algorithms

Notably, STREAMLINE does NOT automate the following elements, as they are still best
completed by human experts: (1) feature engineering, or feature construction,
(2) feature encoding (e.g. apply one-hot-encoding to categorical features, or
numerically encode text-based feature values), (3) account for bias in data
collection, or (4) anything beyond simple data cleaning (i.e. the pipeline
only removes instances with no class label, or where all feature values are missing).
We recommend users consider conducting these items, as needed, prior to applying STREAMLINE.

***
## What can STREAMLINE be used for?
STREAMLINE can be used as:
1. A tool to quickly run a rigorous ML data analysis over one or more datasets using one or more of the included modeling algorithms
2. A framework to compare established scikit-learn compatible ML modeling algorithms to each other or to new algorithms
3. A baseline standard of comparison (i.e. positive control) with which to evaluate other AutoML tools that seek to optimize ML pipeline assembly as part of their methodology
4. A framework to quickly run an exploratory analysis and/or feature importance estimation/feature selection prior to using some other methodology for ML modeling
5. An educational example of how to integrate some of the many amazing Python-based data science tools currently available (in particular pandas, scipy, optuna, and scikit-learn).
6. A framework from which to create a new, expanded, adapted, or modified ML analysis pipeline
7. A framework to add and evaluate new modeling algorithms (see 'Adding New Modeling Algorithms')

***
## What level of computing skill is required for use?
STREAMLINE offers a variety of use options making it accessible to those with little or no coding experience as well as the seasoned programmer/data scientist. While there is currently no graphical user interface (GUI),
the most naive user needs only know how to navigate their PC file system, specify folder/file paths,
and have a Google Drive account (to run STREAMLINE serially on Google Colab).

Those with a very basic knowledge of python and computer environments can apply
STREAMLINE locally and serially using the included jupyter notebook.

Those comfortable with command lines can run STREAMLINE locally (serially) or in parallel on a computing cluster.

1. A 'Notebook' within Google Colab [Almost Anyone]:
    * Advantages
      * No coding or PC environment experience needed
      * Computing can be performed directly on Google Cloud
      * One-click run of whole pipeline
    * Disadvantages:
      * Can only run pipeline serially
      * Slowest of the run options
      * Limited by google cloud computing allowances (may only work for smaller datasets)
    * Notes: Requires a Google Drive account (free)

2. Locally with Jupyter Notebook (included) [Basic Experience]:
    * Advantages:
      * Allows easy customizability of nearly all aspects of the pipeline with minimal coding/environment experience,
      * Offers in-notebook viewing of results

      * One-click run of whole pipeline
    * Disadvantages:
      * Can only run pipeline serially
      * Slower runtime than from command-line
    * Notes: Requires Anaconda3, Python3, and several other minor Python package installations

3. Locally from the command line [Command-line Users]:
    * Advantages:
      * Typically runs faster than within Jupyter Notebook
      * An easier more versatile option for those with command-line experience

Further codebase adaptation may be needed for clusters types not on the above link.
    * Advantages:
      * By far the fastest, most efficient way to run STREAMLINE
      * Offers ability to run STREAMLINE over 7 types of HPC systems
      * Multiple HPC run strategies available for flexibility

## Is STREAMLINE reproducible?
STREAMLINE is completely reproducible when the `timeout` parameter is set to `None`,
ensuring training of the same models with the same performance whenever the same datasets,
pipeline settings, and random seed are used.

When `timeout` is not set to `None`, STREAMLINE output can sometimes vary slightly (particularly when parallelized)
since Optuna (for hyperparameter optimization) may not complete the same
number of optimization trials within the user specified time limit on different
computing resources. However, having a `timeout` value specified helps ensure STREAMLINE run completion
within a reasonable time frame.

## STREAMLINE Implementation Highlights
* Overview
 * Pipeline includes reliable default run parameters that can be adjusted for further customization.
 * Easily compare ML performance between multiple target datasets (e.g. with different feature subsets)
 * Easily conduct an exploratory analysis including: (1) basic dataset characteristics: data dimensions, feature stats, missing value counts, and class balance, (2) detection of categorical vs. quantiative features, (3) feature correlation (with heatmap), and (4) univariate analyses with Chi-Square (categorical features), or Mann-Whitney U-Test (quantitative features).

* Preprocessing
 * Option to manually specify which features to treat as categorical vs. quantitative.
 * Option to manually specify features in loaded dataset to ignore in analysis.
 * Option to utilize 'group' cross validation partitioning: Case/control pairs or groups that have been matched based on one or more covariates will be kept together within CV data partitions.
 * Imputation is completed using mode imputation for categorical variables first, followed by MICE-based iterative imputation for quantitaive features. There is an option to use mean imputation for quantitative features when imputation computing cost is prohibitive in large datasets.

* Feature Importance and Selection
 * Data scaling, imputation, and feature selection are all conducted within respective CV partitions to prevent data leakage (i.e. testing data is not seen for any aspect of learning until final model evaluation).
 * The scaling, imputation, and feature selection data transformations (based only on the training data) are saved (i.e. 'pickled') so that they can be applied in the same way to testing partitions, and in the future to any replication data.
 * Collective feature selection is used: Both mutual information (proficient at detecting univariate associations) and MultiSURF (a Relief-based algorithm proficient at detecting both univariate and epistatic interactions) are run, and features are only removed from consideration if both algorithms fail to detect an informative signal (i.e. score > 0). This ensures that interacting features that may have no univariate association with class are not removed from the data prior to modeling.
 * Automatically outputs average feature importance bar-plots from feature importance/feature selection phase.
 * Since MultiSURF scales linearly with # of features and quadratically with # of instances, there is an option to select a random instance subset for MultiSURF scoring to reduce computational burden.

* Modeling
 * Includes 3 rule-based machine learning algorithms: ExSTraCS, XCS, and eLCS (to run optionally). These 'learning classifier systems' have been demonstrated to be able to detect complex associations while providing human interpretable models in the form of IF:THEN rule-sets. The ExSTraCS algorithm was developed by our research group to specifically handle the challenges of scalability, noise, and detection of epistasis and genetic heterogeneity in biomedical data mining.  
 * Utilizes the 'optuna' package to conduct automated Bayesian hyperparameter optimization during modeling (and optionally outputs plots summarizing the sweep).
 * We have sought to specify a comprehensive range of relevant hyperparameter options for all included ML algorithms.
 * Some ML algorithms that have a build in strategy to gather model feature importance estimates (i.e. LR,DT,RF,XGB,LGB,GB,eLCS,XCS,ExSTraCS) These can be used in place of permutation feature importance estimates by setting the parameter `use_uniform_fi` to 'False'.
 * All other algorithms rely on estimating feature importance using permutation feature importance.
 * All models are evaluated, reporting 16 classification metrics: Accuracy, Balanced Accuracy, F1 Score, Sensitivity(Recall), Specificity, Precision (PPV), True Positives (TP), True Negatives (TN), False Positives (FP), False Negatives (FN), Negative Predictive Value (NPV), Likeliehood Ratio + (LR+), Likeliehood Ratio - (LR-), ROC AUC, PRC AUC, and PRC APS.
 * All models are saved as 'pickle' files so that they can be loaded and reapplied in the future.

* Post-Analysis
 * Outputs ROC and PRC plots for each ML modeling algorithm displaying individual n-fold CV runs and average the average curve.
 * Outputs boxplots for each classification metric comparing ML modeling performance (across n-fold CV).
 * Outputs boxplots of feature importance estimation for each ML modeling algorithm (across n-fold CV).
 * Outputs our proposed 'composite feature importance plots' to examine feature importance estimate consistency (or lack of consistency) across all ML models (i.e. all algorithms)
 * Outputs summary ROC and PRC plots comparing average curves across all ML algorithms.
 * Collects run-time information on each phase of the pipeline and for the training of each ML algorithm model.
 * For each dataset, Kruskall-Wallis and subsequent pairwise Mann-Whitney U-Tests evaluates statistical significance of ML algorithm modeling performance differences for all metrics.
 * The same statistical tests (Kruskall-Wallis and Mann-Whitney U-Test) are conducted comparing datasets using the best performing modeling algorithm (for a given metric and dataset).
 * Outputs boxplots comparing performance of multiple datasets analyzed either across CV runs of a single algorithm and metric, or across average for each algorithm for a single metric.
 * A formatted PDF report is automatically generated giving a snapshot of all key pipeline results.
 * A script is included to apply all trained (and 'pickled') models to an external replication dataset to further evaluate model generalizability. This script (1) conducts an exploratory analysis of the new dataset, (2) uses the same scaling, imputation, and feature subsets determined from n-fold cv training, yielding 'n' versions of the replication dataset to be applied to the respective models, (3) applies and evaluates all models with these respective versions of the replication data, (4) outputs the same set of aforementioned boxplots, ROC, and PRC plots, and (5) automatically generates a new, formatted PDF report summarizing these applied results.
