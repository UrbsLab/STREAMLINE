# Command-line Parameters

## Overview
Here we review the run parameters available for each of the 11 phases and provide some additional run examples. 
We remind users that the parameter names described for the above notebooks sometimes different than the argument 
names when using STREAMLINE from the command-line (for brevity). 
The additional examples illustrate how to flexibly adapt STREAMLINE to user needs. All examples below assume that class 
and instance labels set to default values for simplicity. Run parameters that are necessary to set are marked as 
'MANDATORY' under 'Default Value'.
