# STREAMLINE Run Parameters

## Overview
Here we review the run parameters available for each of the 11 phases and provide some additional run examples. 
We remind users that the parameter names described for the above notebooks sometimes different from the argument 
names when using STREAMLINE from the command-line (for brevity).
