Description: Phase 4 of STREAMLINE - This 'Job' script is called by FeatureSelectionMain.py and generates an average summary of feature importances
            across all CV datasets from phase 3 and conducts collective feature selection to remove features prior to modeling that show no association
            with class, or reduce the feature space down to some maximum number of most informative features. It is run for a single dataset from the
            original target dataset folder (data_path) in Phase 1 (i.e. feature selection completed for all cv
            training and testing datasets).
